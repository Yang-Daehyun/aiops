## 3-1:  Introduction

In this portion of the lab, you will be installing the **Bee Travels** application.   **Bee Travels** is a microservices based travel agency application that runs in OpenShift.  As part of the installation, you will learn how to add **Website Monitoring** into the application.  This will add javascript injection into the web pages so that you can capture **End User Experience (EUM)** / **Real User Monitoring (RUM)** data from the end users that are accessing the web pages.

The **Bee Travels** GitHub repository that you will be using was cloned from the official GitHub location that can be found here:  https://github.com/bee-travels.  You'll find additional information about **Bee Travels** at that site.  The application was modified slightly to work in the environment where your application will be installed.

***

## 3-2:  Create Website Within Instana
If you want to capture EUM/RUM data within Instana, you must first create a website within the GUI (or via API).  Open the Instana GUI within your browser. 

On left side navigation, select **Websites & Mobile Apps**. You'll see a dialog where you can entire a Website Name.  Enter **Bee Travels** as the website name.  Then, click the **Add Website** button.

A dialog containing **javascript** will open.  You can either copy the **javascript** or leave this dialog open so that we can use it later.  The javascript is used for **javascript injection** to gather the EUM/RUM data from the end users that access the Bee Travels application.  This **javascript** must be added to the web pages that make up the application. 

***

## 3-3:  Install Bee Travels

You will be performing the installation steps from the **control node**.  Within the **control node** change directory to /media or another directory where you can download the **Bee Travels** application.

You will need to perform some of the steps in these instructions as root.  Type the following command:
```sh
sudo su -

```

Within the /media directory, clone the GitHub repository by typing:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/IBM/instana-openshift.git

```

This will create a directory within the /media directory named **instana-openshift**.  Change directory to **instana-openshift** directory:
```sh
cd instana-openshift

```

Next, you will add the **javascript** to the web pages so that the application can capture the EUM/RUM data.  You will be editing the index.html file that is used for the front end of the **Bee Travels** applicdation.

Use vi to edit /media/instana-openshift/src/services/ui/frontend/public/index.html
```sh
vi /media/instana-openshift/src/services/ui/frontend/public/index.html

```

Within the editor, you will see the following at the top of the HTML file.
![](images/index.png)

Immediately after **<head\>**, add the **javascript** that was copied from the Instana UI.  If you don't have the **javascript** copied, go back into the Instana UI and copy the block of **javascript**.

Then, paste the **javascript** block immediately after **<head\>**

The section should now look as follows, keeping in mind that some of your javascript will be slightly different to match your Instana server.

Save the file in **vi** by typing **:wq**.

Next, you will be setting up a secure route to access the registry.  

First, confirm that the **image-registry** service exists.  Type:
```sh
oc get svc -n openshift-image-registry
```

You should see output similar to this:
![](images/imageRegistry.png)

Now, create a secured route for the **image-registry**.   This route uses reencrypt TLS termination.  Type the following command:

```sh
oc create route reencrypt --service=image-registry -n openshift-image-registry

```

You should see results similar to this:
![](images/secureRoute.png)

Next, retrieve the **hostname** and **port** that were assigned to the **image-registry** route.  Run the following command:
```sh
oc get route image-registry -n openshift-image-registry

```

You will see an output similar to what's shown below.  
![](images/host.png)

In this example, there is no port number because it is using the HTTPS port.

Copy the hostname into your clipboard.

We will now set a **HOST** environment variable to match the **Host** and **Port** retieved in the previous step.  Type the following command, but replace <hostname\> with the hostname that you copied to your clipboard.

```sh
export HOST=<hostname>
```

Example:  **export HOST=image-registry-openshift-image-registry.<cluster domain\>**

Next, login to the internal docker registry by typing:
```sh
docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) $HOST

```

The output should show that the login succeeded.
![](images/dockerLogin.png)

The installation script requires **yarn** to be installed.  Install yarn by typing:
```sh
npm install --global yarn

```

Next, you will run a script that will build and deploy the **Bee Travels** application.  Run the following command:
```sh
./build-and-deploy.sh -d $HOST
```

You will see a number of steps in the script execute. 

You may see the following warning appear on the screen.  You can ignore this warning.
![](images/warning.png)

When the script is finished, switch to the bee-travels namespaces and run the **oc get pods** command to confirm that the **Bee Travels** pods are running.

```sh
oc project bee-travels
oc get pods

```

You should see 5 pods running as shown below.
![](images/pods.png)

If the pods have not all started, wait a minute or two and run the **oc get pods** command again.

If you notice one of the pods in an error state such as CrashLoopBackoff, delete by typing **oc delete pod <pod name\>** where you replace <pod name\> with the name of the pod that is not running.

Once all of the pods are running, you need to expose a route so that the application is available externally.  Type the following command:
```sh
oc expose service ui

```

This will expose the **ui** service as a route.

Type the following command to see the route:
```sh
oc get route

```

You will see results similar to this:
![](images/route.png)

If desired, you can paste the route into a browser and bring up the **Bee Travels** user interface.  Make sure you specify HTTP.  For example:  http://ui-bee-travels.<cluster domain\>

You have successfully installed the **Bee Travels** application.

***

## 3-4:  Automated Load

Finally, you can generate some automated workload against the application.  The traffic generation scripts are in the **traffic** directory.  

Change directory to the **/media/instana-openshift/traffic** directory by typing:

```sh
cd /media/instana-openshift/traffic

```

Next, run the npm install command:
```
npm install

```

The automated load can't be run as root.  Switch user to **jammer** by typing **exit**
```sh
exit

```

Finally, generate traffic by typing:   node traffic.js <NUM_CALLS\> <ROUTE\>
WHERE:
- NUM_CALLS - refers to how many calls will be made to the Bee Travels application. Each call will make 2 requests to the application. One will be for searching hotels for a random city and the other will be for searching car rentals for the same random city.
- ROUTE - refers to the created route's location/url from OpenShift. Make sure there is no trailing /

NOTE: Make sure you specify **https://** for the URL. Don't just past the hostname for your route.

Example:  **node traffic.js 1000 https://ui-bee-travels.<cluster domain\>**

Leave this window open.  Any time you need to generate traffic to the application, re-run the previous command.

***

## 3-3:  Summary

In this exercise you have installed the **Bee Travels** application and you have learned out to add the EUM/RUM instrumentation into the webpages of a containerized application.  You also have tools that will generate automated workload against the installed application.

Proceed to section 4 where you will setup IBM Middleware and monitoring for IBM MQ and IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE).
